<br /> 

## Client Satisfaction Section

This section shows the number of :

- Active Clients 
- Social Fans 
- Keywords 
- Campaigns  


This section is basically used to show the number of service attributes for any company/organization.

The cool thing about this section is that I have used jQuery so that the numbers run like an ascending counter! This can be a plus point to make your site more professional. 

Basic jQuery is used to make this counter up.

<br /> 

## OUR PRICING Section (Bootstrap)

An Important section for any organization, the pricing section, is made with 3 cards, which can be used to serve different plans.

The cool thing about this section is, as soon as you hover on any section, the color of that section changes.

This effect will be put on wiki's page, you can see there.

<br /> 

## CLIENTS TESTINOMIALS Section (Bootstrap)

Client testimonial section, made by Bootstrap Carousel, but I have customized it to look more professional. 

This type of card section can be made using the Bootstrap carousel. [Bootstrap Carousel]

<br /> 


## Contact Us Section

The contact us section is made using basic HTML5 form validation. 

The cool thing is here, that the submit button is not visible till the time user does not hover on the contact form, as soon as the user hovers over the contact form, the submit button is visible.

<br /> 

## Newsletter Section (Bootstrap)

A basic responsive newsletter section, using the input forms by Bootstrap, & customizing it so that it looks more professional.


## Footer Section

A basic responsive footer section, which is present on every website.


## To The Top Button

A responsive button floats on the right side on the screen, which can be clicked & it will take up to the header of the page.

Basically, takes you to the top of the page.
